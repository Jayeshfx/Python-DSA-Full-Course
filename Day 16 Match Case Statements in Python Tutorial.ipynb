    "To implement switch-case like characteristics very similar to if-else functionality, we use a match case in python. If you are coming from a C, C++ or Java like language, you must have heard of switch-case statements. If this is your first language, dont worry as I will tell you everything you need to know about match case statements in this video!\n",
    "\n",
    "A match statement will compare a given variableâ€™s value to different shapes, also referred to as the pattern. The main idea is to keep on comparing the variable with all the present patterns until it fits into one.\n",

    "- The match keyword\n",
    "- One or more case clauses\n",
    "- Expression for each case\n",
    "\n",
    "The case clause consists of a pattern to be matched to the variable, a condition to be evaluated if the pattern matches, and a set of statements to be executed if the pattern matches."
